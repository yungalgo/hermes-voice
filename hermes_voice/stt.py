"""Streaming STT port + adapter factory (Ports & Adapters).

The voice turn loop consumes a provider-agnostic stream of normalized turn
events; this module defines that contract and the factory that builds a
concrete adapter for it.

The canonical home of the normalized event names is HERE — every adapter
(``deepgram_flux_stt``, ``cartesia_ink_stt``) maps its provider-specific wire
events onto these constants, and the turn loop branches only on these. They are
re-exported by ``deepgram_flux_stt`` so existing imports keep working.

  start_of_turn      -> the user began speaking (barge-in trigger)
  update             -> incremental partial transcript
  eager_end_of_turn  -> medium-confidence end -> start the agent speculatively
  turn_resumed       -> the user kept talking past the eager signal -> cancel
  end_of_turn        -> high-confidence end -> commit the turn

Default provider is Deepgram Flux. Cartesia Ink-2 is a second adapter behind
the same port for A/B comparison (turn-taking + latency); accuracy is out of
scope for the seam.
